    <p>I started work on the new Riverview Hotel together with my father “Doody Walsh” in December 1957. It had only recently been burnt down, in very suspicious circumstances. The owner at the time was “Claude Barber” who also worked with us, to keep costs down. Claude had done the plans, and dad & I worked for a generous wage.</p>
    <p>I can recall him opening the bar, well before the job was completed.</p>
    <p>Part of the old toilets out the back, were still working, and these were used until the new toilets were connected up. I remember a rather heavy gentleman, was using the WC, then the whole pan collapsed, and he finished up with over 40 stiches in his behind. Back in those times, nobody would think of suing for compensation, it was just “bad luck”.</p>
    <p>Claude himself was a real rouge, and near enough was good enough, he bent the rules to suit, if he could save a pound. I believe he later moved to “Burleigh Heads”. But would have passed on by now. For your information, “Barry Scott” and “Foxy Graham” are cousins, whom I believe you already know.</p>
    <p>Kind regards………Harry Walsh.</p>
