    <p>Our rooms have recently been renovated and are presented clean and serviced daily. There are a combination of rooms available. The rooms are situated upstairs from the pub and have a large balcony available to sit quietly and enjoy a cup of coffee and take in the view over the river. Alternatively you can join the many characters downstairs for what will be a memorable experience.</p>
